later spread of edi and automated distribution centersâhave been the real movers herechapters  through  analyze developments in the retail sectorafter this introduction chapter  âœthe past as prologueâ offers a brief history of recent technological and human resource developments in retailing apparel productionâincluding the role of jobbers contractors and manufacturersâand textile enterprisesalthough these developments are very much a work in progress informationintegrated channels of production and distribution are emergingthe developments reported here offer a prototype of the new links among manufacturers other suppliers retailers and consumersthis stream of general debate however is seldom related to a detailed study or analysis of the impact of such developments on the us textile or apparel industriesbut the longer term viability of american textile centers will depend on the development of infrastructures capable of supporting advanced textile production in countries close to the us market such as mexico and elsewhere in latin americaadoption of justintime inventory management by manufacturers also represents a significant development since changes in inventories have often been an important source of businesscycle fluctuationsbut these initiatives are still at an early stage of developmentfinally the central role played by retailers in development and operation of the channel points to the fact that any measureâwhether taken by the government through voluntary compliance programs or via collective bargainingâmust include their participation and supportnow pointofsales information provides retailers with reliable information on market developments and hence gives them more leverage in dealing with direct suppliers and others further from ultimate consumersa number of developments many linked to issues we have discussed indicate both the potential and limitations of electronic retailing thus although internet retailing will certainly grow as a channel of distribution the most essential longer term developments will involve the expansion of lean retailing principles to a wider and wider variety of goods sold by a decreasing number of major retailersin a related vein the future of domestic producers also relies on their development of capabilities for supplying fashion products on a replenishment basisonce again the development of web sites to undertake some of these connections represents an important first step in this directionhis story underscores the international role of textiles and apparel their impetus in national economic development and their place in conflicts over domestic production and importsâa theme that recurs throughout us historythis brief historical survey highlights not only the crucial developments that still undergird these industries but also the systems and work practices from an earlier era that no longer match todayâs competitive requirementsother factors drove the development

desired design or construction modificationsin my three decades of teaching university courses in child development i have come to know thousands of students many of whom were parents or who became parents soon after completing my classas a byproduct of those experiences parents repeatedly approached me with concerns about how to foster their childâs development in the early yearsat an even more fundamental level contemporary parents have begun to doubt their own ecacy in their childrenâs developmentsecond information about child development disseminated to parents is increasingly voluminous but at the same time contradictoryin view of these diculties it is little wonder that so many american parents express a sense of powerlessness and inadequacy when it comes to aecting their childrenâs development an obvious solution to reconciling parentsâ employment needs with young childrenâs rearing needs is to make highquality nonparental care with characteristics known to promote healthy psychological development widely available and aordablein a recent survey of parents whose children were enrolled in several hundred randomly chosen childcare centers across four states over  percent believed that their preschoolersâ experiences were far better than experts in early childhood development judged those experiences to be instead positive supportive parenting that endured even when it marked a change from an early period of parental retreat or negative interaction was linked to favorable child development including persistence in problem solving high selfesteem socially skilled behavior closer friendships and better peer relationshipsalthough the precise extent of familyâwork conïict in american culture is not clear its presence and detrimental impact on parentchild interaction and childrenâs development are well foundedstudies carried out during the s and s on the relationship of maternal employment to childrenâs development revealed many positive outcomesâhigher selfesteem better grades in school more positive family and peer relations and less genderstereotyped beliefs but repeatedly eective parenting mediated these favorable developmentswhen employed parents spend generous amounts of time engaged with their child they safeguard the childâs developmentprobably because it reduces work overload parttime maternal employment is associated with better academic and social development than is fulltime employmentprecious few of these parenting manuals are grounded in the explosion of contemporary research on child development that is of signiïcant applied value the roots of these polarized perspectives can be found in centuriesold dramatically opposing philosophies about the nature of children and child developmentthe behaviorist presumption that development can be mechanically engineered by social input guaranteeing brighter socially more mature children is not borne out by the evidencein the tradition of rousseau the psychoanalysts argued that powerful biological forces channel development through four psychosexual stagesswiss biologist jean piaget twentiethcentury giant of cognitive development proposed a theory in which an intrinsically motivated child acts on the world noticing discrepancies between the environment and inner structures or ways of thinkingin contrast to the behaviorist emphasis on adult tutoring piaget believed that since development follows a natural internally controlled stage sequence what comes from within the child is paramount in guiding cognitive changepiagetâs contribution to the ïeld of child development is enormousespecially important piaget convinced the academic communityâas well as many parents and teachersâthat children are active contributors to their own development have their own ways of understanding the world and must be developmentally ready if teaching is to be successfulrather than tracking how well pupils keep pace with norms or the average performance of sameage peers openclassroom teachers evaluate children on an individual basisâin relation to their own prior developmentas our discussion already suggests a central piagetian tenet is that it is foolhardy to try to speed up developmentbecause piaget stressed the supremacy of childrenâs engagement with their surroundings over adult teaching parentsâ and teachersâ contributions to development are severely reduced relative to the childâs this along with the crosscultural ïndings just described raises doubts about piagetâs assumption that discovery learning rather than adult teaching is the most eective way to foster developmentas damonâs message suggests in building an eective vision of child development and child rearing neither the childâs inner thoughts and feelings nor the role of adult guidance can be singularly extolled or wholeheartedly ignoredtoday sound theories and educational strategies exist that are neither adult nor childcentered but instead portray both as participating actively jointly and inseparably in the process of developmenton only one point is the popular parenting literature unanimous the vital importance of getting development o to a good start during the preschool yearsafter decades of theoretical division and debate a new more complex view of child development is coalescing in the ïeld supported by rapidly accumulating research evidencethe fragmented polarized theories of the past are giving way to more equitable theories emphasizing that the child and the social environment interact and that the contributions of each to development cannot be separated and weighted in a simplistic onesided mannera second step is an appreciation of the multiplicity of factors that contribute to developmentâan understanding that spells out parentsâ vital role yet clariïes how it joins with other forces to aect childrenâs development and wellbeingchild development a new consensusat the dawn of a new millennium a fresh set of theories of child development has blossomedmany factors contribute to developmentthese elements include the childâs heredity and biological constitution the people and objects in the childâs everyday settings of home childcare center school and neighborhood community resources for child rearing such as familyfriendly workplace policies and highquality aordable child care and cultural values and customs related to child development and educationa common human genetic heritage and basic regularities in childrenâs physical and social environments yield certain universal broad outlines of developmentwithin this dynamic system in which inner and outer forces jointly engender development each contributing factor inïuencesâand is inïuenced byâthe othersbrain developmenthow does early experience join with biology to aect brain developmentnotice how for the biological side of brain development to go forward appropriate stimulation is essential while formation of neural connections

necessary for children to reach their full genetic potentialin burton white and robert heldâs classic study of the impact of early stimulation on development young babies in a barren institution given

development of shy and sociable children psychologist jerome kagan followed several hundred youngsters from infancy into the school years repeatedly observing their behavior and measuring their physiological responses to highly stimulating unfamiliar eventsshy and sociable children also require dierent adult interventions to promote exploration of their surroundingsâan activity that as piaget pointed out is essential for optimal cognitive developmentfinally culture aects the likelihood that parents and teachers will respond to shy children in ways that foster their developmentenvironmental forces from adultâchild interaction to cultural values join with heredity to aect the development of children with other temperamental dispositions as wellthroughout this bookâand especially in chapter  which addresses the development of children with physical and mental disabilitiesâwe will see many more examples of these synergistic eectsindeed many eminent child development researchers have countered harrisâs thesisfurthermore no conclusive evidence exists for the assertion that the most consequential environment for childrenâs development is the peer group rather than the familyin fact this overriding emphasis on peers as a source of positive development is itself a product of our cultureit leads parents like noah and suzanne who are on the cusp of a dramatic period of development in their yearold sonâs life to express grave doubts about their own importancethe central idea of sociocultural theory is that the child and his or her social surroundings join to provide direction to development participation in social life guides and energizes the childâs mastery of new culturally adaptive skills by the s many american psychologists and educatorsâdoubting the piagetian view of development and desiring to account for wide variation in childrenâs competenciesâembraced vygotskyâs ideas with enthusiasmthese undergo a natural course of

universals of developmentthis leads to a crucial change in developmentthe natural line of development makes closer contact with its surrounding social context merges with it and is transformed by itvygotsky emphasized that to understand childrenâs development it is necessary to understand the social situations adults devise for thembecause vygotsky regarded language as the major bridge between our social and mental worlds he viewed language acquisition as the most signiïcant milestone in childrenâs cognitive developmentthe sociocultural vision is very dierent from behaviorism which views development as directly imposed or shaped by external forcesthe core lesson to be learned from our discussion so far is that development is a matter of childrenâs geneticbiological potential undergoing a cultural metamorphosis a process that cannot take place without parents and teachers as thoughtful and committed participants in childrenâs livesfrom the sociocultural perspective parents and teachers are leaders in awakening childrenâs minds and fostering their development children are apprenticed to these expertsvygotsky who studied and wrote about childrenâs development in russia in the early twentieth century was deeply interested in how interdependencyâchildrenâs close ties to their communityâcan pave the way to competence and autonomyan overwhelming consensus of research shows that sensitive caregivingâresponding to the babyâs cries for physical care and stimulation promptly consistently and appropriatelyâsupports the development of a secure attachment relationshipto answer this question vygotsky proposed a special concept the zone of proximal developmentkeeping it in mind can help parents and teachers interact with children in ways that lead their development
