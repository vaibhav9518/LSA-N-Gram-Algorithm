ability to directly bind to dna     its interaction with other dnabinding transcription factors such as oaz sip and hoxc       and also its interaction with the master transcriptional coactivator cbpp     smad is an essential functional partner in smadregulated transcription and also interacts with cbpp via a domain within the central linker region named as sad smad activation domain     since cbpp has intrinsic histone acetyltransferase hat activity and participates in chromatin remodeling the recruitment of cbpp into the dnabinding complexes of smad and smad is likely a critical step in smadregulated gene activationthe s proteasome is responsible for the bulk turnover of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins in eukaryotic cells and also plays a key role in the regulation of cell cycle

general are involved in the transcriptional control of developmental processes      in humans mutations in each of the three runx genes are associated with disease caused by defective control of cell

apoptosis and intercellular interactions during morphogenesis              members of the bone morphogenetic protein family function in a gene dosage dependent manner during development and participate in ocular development        therefore mutations that alter the level of bmps or alter the degree of bmp signaling are candidates to contribute to axenfeldrieger syndrome and other conditions involving anterior segment malformation elevated iop and glaucomagenetic screens have identified a large number of genes named snf sucrose nonfermenting that are required for derepression of suc transcription in the absence of glucose    biochemical and cell biological experiments indicate that net acts as part of a complex named rent that tethers cdc to the nucleolus and inhibits cdc phosphatase activity and that cdc and tem are required for the release of cdc from net at the end of mitosis        consistent with this notion both net tab which encodes a mutant version of net with presumably reduced affinity for cdc and cdc tab which encodes a mutant version of cdc with reduced affinity for tabnet bypass cdcî      both net tab and cdc tab impinge directly on mitotic exit
